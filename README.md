# PokeMapMobile

PokeMapMobile is a web service that brings your scanning results from your [PokemonGo-Map](https://github.com/PokemonGoMap/PokemonGo-Map) to your phone. Get the mobile app on Google Play (link here). iOS app is ready, but without a developer account it can't be published. If you would like to donate to support development.

* Background location tracking to focus your maps to scan where you currently are through your phone's GPS
* Push notifications via [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com) to notify you of pokemon even while the app is in the background or when your phone is locked.
* Customize which Pokemon you are notified of as well as how far the pokemon is. 
* View Pokemon Locations through the in-app Map or Google Maps locations via Pushbullet
